    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>2-3 green chilies, slit</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped mint leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons biriyani masala (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>4-5 whole cloves</li>
        <li>2-3 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>1-2 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, and sauté for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces, yogurt, biriyani masala, mint leaves, and coriander leaves. Mix well and cook until the chicken is browned and cooked through.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained basmati rice, whole cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and salt. Cook the rice until it is about 70% cooked (it should still have a bite to it).</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken mixture in the pot.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Once done, gently fluff the biriyani with a fork to mix the rice and chicken.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with raita, salad, or boiled eggs on the side.</li>
    </ol>
